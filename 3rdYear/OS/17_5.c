/** ::------ ASSIGNMENT DETAILS ------::
 * Assignment 5: Avoiding DEADLOCK using Thread Programming
 *
 * Problem Definition:
   The objective of this assignment is to avoid deadlock. For this purpose define two global 
   variables (Total_1 and Total_2) and initialize both of them to 100000. You should also have 
   two mutexes to protect these two global variables. You need to create three threads also (Th1, 
   Th2 and Th3). 
   
   The function of thread Th1 is to generate a random quantity (not more than 10) and subtract 
   that quantity from Total_2 and add that quantity to the Total_1. Likewise, The function of 
   thread Th2 is to generate a random quantity (not more than 10) and subtract that quantity 
   from Total_1 and add that quantity to the Total_2. While manipulating the Totals, the Th1 and 
   Th2 should lock both the mutex and then unlock it after changing the Totals.
   
   The function of the thread Th3 is to keep displaying the individual Totals and Grand Total 
   (sum of Total_1 and Total_2). Make sure the displayed values are consistent.
   
   Note that this program should run forever.
   
   The order of locking and unlocking the Mutex is very important, because thatâ€™s what avoids a 
   Deadlock or creates one. Once you correctly identify the order for avoiding Deadlock, you 
   should upload the program. Also, include that information (as a comment in your source file) 
   regarding the order for creating Deadlock.
   
   Make sure there are enough printf in your program so that it can be clearly understood that there is no Deadlock.

 * ::------ INPUT DESCRIPTION ------::
   This program does not take any input.
 *
 * ::------ OUTPUT DESCRIPTION ------::
   The program creates three threads, both of which try to modify the values of two global
   variables Total_1 and Total_2. The threads acquire locks on two mutex objects and enter
   a deadlock condition where both threads are waiting for the other thread to relinquish its
   lock on one of the mutexes.
