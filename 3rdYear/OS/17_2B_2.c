/**
 * ::------ ASSIGNMENT DETAILS ------::
 * Assignment 2B: IPC using Named Pipe (FIFO)
 *
 * Problem Definition:
   Create two processes. Transfer 1GB file from process1 to process2 using a
   FIFO. Now, transfer the same file from process2 to process1 using another
   FIFO. Now, compare the two files to make sure that the same file has returned
   back. Also, print the time required to do this double transfer. Attach this output
   to the source file as a comment.
   To create FIFO, you can either use shell command or system call.
   To create a large file you can use the relevant command.
   Use 'ls â€“l' command to show the FIFO and the large file. Attach this output to
   the source file as a comment.
 *
 * ::------ INPUT DESCRIPTION ------::
   This program does not take any input.
 *
 * ::------ OUTPUT DESCRIPTION ------::
   Any existing FIFOs or files with same name as the FIFOs are removed, and new ones are created.
   The program transfers a large file (1GB) through a named pipe (FIFO) from a process P1
   to a process P2. The transfer process is described through print statements that indicate
   when a process finishes transferring the file. The total time for the double transfer
   from P1 to P2 and back to P1 is printed and the file contents are compared to see if they
   are same. Finally the "ls -l" command is run via a system() call and the output is printed.
 */

/**
 * ::------ COMPILATION COMMAND ------::
    gcc 17_2B.c -o 17_2B -Wall
 *
 * ::------ EXECUTION SEQUENCE ------::
    In your Linux terminal, type: ./17_2B
    The program creates and deletes the large files on its own using system calls.
